          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>There appears to be a slight positive correlation between poverty and obesity. This chart shows that states with 
            a higher poverty rate tend to have a higher obesity rate as well. There are some outliers, however, such as
            Washington D.C. It has an above average poverty rate but a lower obesity rate than expected. This may be due to 
            the fact that it is a city rather than a state, therefore the demographics are different than states that have
            both rural and urban areas. </p>

          <p>There appears to be no correlation between age and propensity to smoke. however, this data set only looks at 
            middle aged people so the correlation may be different if a wider population was used. </p>
